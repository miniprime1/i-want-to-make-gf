# Project: "I want to make gf."

## Problem: Begining.
 - My friend sent me a picture that explain how to make a gf: type a lot of "1"

## Problem: Solving.
 - I decided to code the program that type 1 automatically.
 - I tried a C++ but failed and I tried python too but it's slow.
 - Finally, I find way to type keys(keybd_event(user32.dll)) in C# and I made it.

## Problem: Conclusion.
 - It was good good experience because I learned a function about keyboard event.
 - But, I don't have gf after do this yet. (PS. I hate my friend)
